***OSH Guardian***

OSH Guardian is an integrated monitoring system that provides individualized environmental risk assessment and management solutions. 

The system is composed of three parts:
1. Monitoring devices: These devices measure dust, noise, UVR, illuminance, temperature, and humidity and check the presence of flammable gases – liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), propane, hydrogen, butane, methane, and carbon monoxide. The devices send the measures encrypted to the cloud-based server, and ideally should be attached to employees' clothing during their shift.
2. Cloud-based server: Collects and processes data received from the monitoring devices. It hosts a web application to be used by companies to register employees  and provide their health information regarding common diseases and symptoms related to the monitored quantities. The measurements and the health information are analysed by the recommendation system using both machine learning and pre-fixed rules to generate alerts for the company. A second web application shows graphs with workers’ exposure data.
3. Mobile application: It can be used for workers to check their exposure data.

The figure below shows the system's architecture.

The project is organized as follows:

* **device:** contains the source code monitoring device.

* **ia_model:** contains the project structure divided into the following resources:

   * connectors: contains the Postgres class that allows connecting/querying data from the relational database.

   * migrations: contains the PostgresSchema class responsible for generating the data structure for storing synthetic data generated by sensor type, enabling the development of AI models.

   * datasets: directory structure necessary for the data generation script to be able to save and access sensor data during model training.

   * experiment_models: contains the Jupyter Notebook files:

      * a) generate_dataset_sensors.ipynb: responsible for encapsulating the sequence of steps to generate synthetic data per sensor, and exporting it from Postgres to pandas format, facilitating model training.
      * b) views_for_models.ipynb: responsible for generating the random tree graph.
      * c) metrics_*_.xls: brings together all metrics (precision, recall, f1, roc-auc) from the training and testing stages for all models tested per sensor.
      * d) sensor subdirectories: contains a Jupyter notebook file "exploration_ia_models_sensor.ipynb" that encapsulates the steps to generate the models and collect the data, saving the model and metrics for the sensor in the respective directory of the same name.
      * e) graphs: brings together some plots grouping results of the tested models.
   * ClassifierModels: responsible for encapsulating the tests of different shallow learning models
   * ModelTests: responsible for standardizing test execution, saving models and metrics collected during the training and testing phase.
   * XboostModel: class responsible for generating the XBoost model, and collecting evaluation metrics according to other tests.
   * requeriments.txt: contains all libraries used in this project.
   
* **utils:** contains auxiliary functions for other classes in this project.
